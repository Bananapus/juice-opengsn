# Juicebox OpenGSN (WIP)
Extension to allow customizable usage of GSN from a Juicebox project

## Idea
Juicebox projects may want to incentivize users to perform certain actions by paying gas for its users. Some examples of this are:
- Pay the gas for a user when they pay the project more than 100 DAI
- Pay the gas for a user when they are voting in governance
- Pay the gas for a user when they call `distribute`

This extension attempts to create a minimal base implementation that can be build upon and configured by projects to their liking.
